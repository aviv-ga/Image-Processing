Filter size determines the amount of neighbours to consider when blurring the image.
For example: size 1 is the ID transform, because we don't consider any neighbours only the pixel itself.
size 3 will consider 2 neighbours of each pixel, and so on.
As the filter's size grows larger, the edges will get more blurred (so is the image, but we will see it clearly on the edges)
