Q: The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z. If a division
will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash

One of the calculation in the quantization procedure is p(z), p(z)= segment / number of pixels in the segment.
Therefore an empty segment will lead to division by zero error.
