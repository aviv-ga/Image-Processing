There is a major difference between change_Same and change rate.
When changing the rate by 2, we "run" the data faster, meaning we throw away one data over one we play.
2 sec of speech will be played at 1 second.
When resizing the data by 2, we cut the high frequencies, therefore the data consists of the lower frequencies.
Playing changed_sample sounds disorgenized.
