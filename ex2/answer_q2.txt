The fast forwarded wav file using phase vocoder is more smoother than fast forwarded wav file using spectrogram scaling.
Due to overlapping, phase correctness needs to be done because information of the wave components is spread over adjacent STFT bins,
therefore phase vocoder needs to scale both the frequency and time domains of audio signals by using phase information.
